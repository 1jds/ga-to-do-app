# Small Homework Task for General Assembly React Course

This repository hosts the code for a small homework task completed in the old class-based React (rather than the more modern function-based React with hooks).

Here is an illustrative image of the project running on http://localhost:3000/

## Pros & Cons

### Cons
Were this code to be refactored, the following things could be improved:
- All unnecesary inline styles could be moved into the `.css` file
- The code could be reorganised into fewer components
- The color-scheme could be changed to aid accessability. Below is an illustrative image which shows the color-contrast of 2.07 on the buttons against the white text.

> Element has insufficient color contrast of 2.07 (foreground color: #ffffff, background color: #55c2da, font size: 14.4pt (19.2px), font weight: normal). Expected contrast ratio of 4.5:1

### Pros
What's good about this project
- The factors mentioned as 'cons' were mostly deliberate choices for practice and experimentation purposes.
- While modern React with functional components and hooks is preferrable, it's always good to know how legacy code works.
